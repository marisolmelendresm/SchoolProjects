Data Structures Find event (Hash Table)

In the second part of the project we used a Hash Table so that the user is
able to search an event with an specific id (ip). We used this data 
structure because of the low complexity it has when searching for a value.
It receives a file with the events ordered by date (Part 1 of the project)
and returns the event the user looked for.
